Project Name: StencilCSG
Project Objective: Doing constructive solid geometry (CSG) with stencil
Project Category: OpenGL

This source is a port from various sources (included in this file) of several autors:
	csg.c - by Tom McReynolds
	opengl32.bas and glu32.bas - by Camilla Berglund
	wGL.bas	- It is added by me

NOTES:
 In the begining of this source code, i used the typelibrary vboglZ.tlb but the result was  not the correct. Can check the bad result by refering the typelibrary in  the program and  taking away the modules (opengl32.bas,glu32.bas and wGL.bas)
